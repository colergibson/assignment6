# Intro to 3D Food Printing

# History

<aside class="Although 3D Printing has been in development since the late 1980s,
3D food printing is a relatively new arrival on the scene.">

 <aside class="While many of the 3D printers focus on 
 sweets  and candy printing there is a growing field for real and actual food 
 use fresh ingredients."> </section>

<aside class="In 2014 Natural Machines introduced the world to Foodini. Foodini 
was designed to be used in home and professional kitchens where users supplied 
fresh ingredients instead of food capsules. While currently the ingredients need
to be in a puree form and have to be cooked separately, this was a large step in
an exciting direction."></section>
