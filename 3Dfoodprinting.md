 <aside class="and in 2014 3D Systems who had purchased the company released the
 first  kitchen-ready 3D food printers. While many of the 3D printers focus on

<aside class="In 2014 Natural Machines introduced the world to Foodini. Foodini 
was designed to be used in home and professional kitchens where users supplied 
fresh ingredients instead of food capsules. While currently the ingredients need
to be in a puree form and have to be cooked separately, this was a large step in
an exciting direction.">
