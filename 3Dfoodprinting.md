# Intro to 3D Food Printing

# History

<aside class="Although 3D Printing has been in development since the late 1980s,
3D food printing is a relatively new arrival on the scene.">

 sweets  and candy printing there is a growing field for real and actual food

  <aside class="In 2014 Natural Machines introduced the world to Foodini. Foodini 
was designed to be used in home and professional kitchens where users supplied 
fresh ingredients instead of food capsules. While currently the ingredients need
to be in a puree form and have to be cooked separately, this was a large step in
an exciting direction.">

# Applications

# Gourmet
<section>
<aside class="3D printing have been newly used for inventing beautiful yet expensive gourmet food.
A 3D printing restaurant called Food Ink serves a two hundred and fifty-pound-nine course meal in London, 
England - all fully 3D printed live in front of the customers. 3D printing each food currently takes two 
to five minutes. Other restaurants that produces 3D printed food includes 3D Samba, a restaurant made by 
a Spanish Michelin-star winning chef, Mateo Blanch. The 3D printer that is commonly used in gourmet food 
printing is made by a Dutch printer manufacturer, byFlow. ByFlow created a portable 3D printer, called the 
Focus 3D printer. The Focus 3D printer can only process paste-like materials, like clay, ceramic, and silicon. 
Food materials that can be printed includes hummus, meat, chocolate, goat cheese, and pizza dough. 
The Focus 3D printer has been demonstrated in 3D Printshows in cities such as Paris, Rome, Singapore, Dubai,
and Las Vegas, drawing attention from molecular gastronomers all over the world.">

<aside class="It is quoted: “The robotic limb (of the 3D printer) has greater precision than any human hand, 
however, it also facilitates control of the molecular gastronomy of printed food.” With the continuous creation 
of intricately created food, the innovative act of 3D printing food may be the next fashionable gourmet experience, 
as more restaurants are keeping an eye on the new technology.">

# Poverty/Hunger Issues
<section>
<aside class="3D Food Printing has been researched to solve the problem of world hunger and poverty. 
This is done by Food Technician Peter Verstrate and Maastricht University professor Mark Post. 
They have been researching on 3D printing beef meat starting from 2013. The process involves 3D 
printing meat grown from beef stem cells. The initial prototype of a 3D printed meat was successful 
and tasted remotely similar to real meat. Despite this, it costs $331,000 to do 3D print meat. If 3D 
food printing costs are higher that of a commodity’s, solving world hunger and poverty is still impossible. 
A benefit of 3D printing meat is that it will reduce environmental threats due to excessive farming and slaughtering. 
The researched has grown since 2013, hiring 25 new, qualified researchers in order to enable a mass-produced, 
yet equally delicious 3D printed meat. 3D printing meat and food can be the culture in a more distant future, 
starting with the research of solving world hunger and poverty, as long as development of 3D food printers can 
drastically reduce costs of 3D printing food.">

# Space
<section>
<aside class="3D Food Printing has been researched for use in Space as well. 
The aim of the research is so astronauts can make personalized recipes and prepare 
food for themselves in Space, especially deep space travel and long missions. 
This will allow astronauts to eat healthier, to their tastes, and more variety. 
NASA has funded a small, research business called “Systems and Materials Research Consultancy” 
in Austin, Texas, to specifically study how to 3D print food in Space. The initial endowment for 
this Phase 1 study was $125,000 for six months.">

# Space
<section>
<aside class="Although the prototype of this 3D printer is done, it has not been used directly in Space. 
Research on the best food to make like frozen food or hot foods, are still being conducted. 
In the future, 3D printing food in space may revolutionize the idea of travelling in Space.">
